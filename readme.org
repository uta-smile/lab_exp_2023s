This is a classification task with 7 categories, involving two files:

+ =train.npz=
+ =test.x.npz=

The training file contains 8,000 samples, each consisting of 100 features and 7 labels. The testing file comprises 2,000 samples, each having 100 features.

To load the files, you can use the following code:

```
import numpy as np
train = np.load('train.npz')
test = np.load('test.x.npz')
train_x, train_y = train['x'], train['y']
test_x = test['x']
```

Your objective is to classify and predict the 2,000 test data samples and obtain 2,000 rows of labels ranging from 0 to 6.

For example:

#+begin_src python
  pred = model(test_x)   # 2000 x 1 matrix
  print(pred)
  # [[0],
  #  [6],
  #  [2],
  #  ...,
  #  [1],
  #  [3]]
  np.savetxt("pred.txt", pred, fmt="%d")
#+end_src
